# Contributing

We have a few things you have to do before contributing. Firstly, only edit files in the `TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode` folder.

## Code Formatting

4 spaces as an indentation and braces on the same line. Eg.

```java
package org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode;

public class VuForiaKey {
    public static final String VUFORIAKEY =
        "";
}
```

Use the Sensor, Movement, and Robot class when possible.
