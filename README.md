#### Description 
Our team code allows the robot to manuever itself using the Vuforia program to draw and compute a virtual navigation map and its sensors to accomplish the desired automation tasks like picking up blocks and moving around the field. Additionally, the team code also allows for manual manuevering via real user input using an Xbox controller and two Android phones.
